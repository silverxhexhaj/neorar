# Supabase Authentication Setup

## Quick Setup

I've already created a `.env.local` file with your Supabase project URL. You just need to add your anon key:

1. Go to [Your Supabase Project Settings](https://app.supabase.com/project/eodggpgpyzegzfbfdvzw/settings/api)
2. Copy the **anon/public key** from the API settings
3. Replace `your-anon-key-here` in `.env.local` with your actual anon key

Your `.env.local` file should look like this:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://eodggpgpyzegzfbfdvzw.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.your-actual-key-here
```

## Getting Your Supabase Credentials

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/)
2. Select your project (eodggpgpyzegzfbfdvzw)
3. Navigate to **Settings > API**
4. Copy your **anon/public key**
5. Update the `.env.local` file

## Database Setup

The authentication system uses Supabase's built-in auth tables. No additional database setup is required for basic authentication.

## Features Included

- ✅ User Registration (Fixed!)
- ✅ User Login
- ✅ User Logout
- ✅ Session Management
- ✅ Protected Routes
- ✅ User Profile Display
- ✅ Toast Notifications
- ✅ Responsive Design with shadcn/ui
- ✅ Debug Tools and Connection Testing
- ✅ Improved Error Handling

## Usage

Once configured, users can:
- Sign up with email and password
- Sign in to existing accounts
- View their profile information
- Sign out securely

The authentication state is managed globally through React Context and persists across page reloads.

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch" Error During Signup/Login

**Issue**: You get a "TypeError: Failed to fetch" error when trying to sign up or log in.

**Solution**: This was caused by using deprecated auth helpers. I've fixed this by:
- Removing `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` dependency
- Using the modern `createClient()` directly from `@supabase/supabase-js`
- Improved error handling for better debugging

### WebSocket Connection Errors

**Issue**: You see WebSocket errors in the console.

**Solution**: These are related to Supabase Realtime. They don't affect authentication but you can:
- Ignore them if you're not using realtime features
- Check your Supabase project settings if you need realtime functionality

### Debug and Testing

Use the built-in debug tools:
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Advanced Test" tab
3. Check the "Debug Information" section at the top
4. Run various connection tests to verify everything is working

### Environment Variables Not Loading

If environment variables aren't loading:
1. Make sure `.env.local` is in your project root
2. Restart your development server: `pnpm dev`
3. Check the Debug Information panel for current status
