# Chat History Implementation - User-Specific Chat Messages

## Problem Solved

Previously, all users shared the same chat history because messages were stored in local React state. Now each user has their own isolated chat history stored in Supabase.

## Architecture

### Database Schema

**Table: `chat_messages`**
- `id` (UUID, Primary Key)
- `user_id` (UUID, Foreign Key to `auth.users`)
- `content` (TEXT)
- `sender` (TEXT, 'user' or 'bot')
- `timestamp` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)
- `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)

### Security Features

- **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled
- Users can only access their own messages
- Automatic user isolation through auth policies
- Cascade delete when user is deleted

### Key Components

1. **ChatService** (`src/lib/chat-service.ts`)
   - Handles all database operations
   - User-specific message CRUD operations
   - Real-time subscriptions support

2. **Updated ChatInterface** (`src/components/chat-interface.tsx`)
   - Loads user messages on mount
   - Saves messages to database in real-time
   - Proper error handling and loading states

3. **Enhanced UserMenu** (`src/components/auth/user-menu.tsx`)
   - Clear chat history functionality
   - Better user experience

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run the Database Migration

Execute the SQL in `SUPABASE_MIGRATION.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```
https://app.supabase.com/project/eodggpgpyzegzfbfdvzw/sql
```

### 2. Test the Implementation

1. **Sign up with first email** (e.g., user1@example.com)
2. **Send some messages** in the chat
3. **Sign out** and **sign up with second email** (e.g., user2@example.com)
4. **Verify** that chat history is empty for the new user
5. **Send different messages** as the second user
6. **Switch back** to the first user and verify their original messages are still there

### 3. Verify Security

- Try accessing another user's messages (should be blocked by RLS)
- Check that messages persist after page refresh
- Confirm messages are cleared when user is deleted

## Features

### ✅ User Isolation
- Each user has completely separate chat history
- No cross-user data leakage
- Secure database policies

### ✅ Persistence
- Messages survive page refreshes
- Chat history maintained across sessions
- Automatic welcome message for new users

### ✅ Real-time Updates
- Messages saved immediately to database
- Support for real-time subscriptions (ready for future use)
- Optimistic UI updates

### ✅ Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks for database errors
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading states during operations

### ✅ User Experience
- Clear chat history option in user menu
- Loading indicators
- Smooth transitions between users

## API Reference

### ChatService Methods

```typescript
// Save a message to database
ChatService.saveMessage(user: User, content: string, sender: 'user' | 'bot')

// Get all messages for a user
ChatService.getMessagesForUser(user: User)

// Clear all messages for a user
ChatService.clearMessagesForUser(user: User)

// Delete a specific message
ChatService.deleteMessage(user: User, messageId: string)

// Get or create welcome message
ChatService.getOrCreateWelcomeMessage(user: User)

// Subscribe to real-time message updates
ChatService.subscribeToMessages(user: User, callback: Function)
```

## Database Policies

The following RLS policies ensure data security:

1. **SELECT**: Users can only view their own messages
2. **INSERT**: Users can only create messages for themselves
3. **UPDATE**: Users can only modify their own messages
4. **DELETE**: Users can only delete their own messages

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create two different user accounts
- [ ] Verify each user has separate chat history
- [ ] Test message persistence after page refresh
- [ ] Test clear chat history functionality
- [ ] Verify messages are saved to database
- [ ] Test error handling with network issues
- [ ] Verify RLS policies prevent cross-user access
- [ ] Test welcome message creation for new users

## Performance Considerations

- **Indexed Queries**: Efficient lookups by user_id and timestamp
- **Batch Operations**: Messages loaded once per user session
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately while saving to database
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuses Supabase client connection

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time message synchronization across tabs
- Message search functionality
- Message export/import
- Message threading/conversations
- Message reactions/likes
- File attachments support

## Troubleshooting

### Messages Not Saving
- Check Supabase connection
- Verify user is authenticated
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure RLS policies are correctly applied

### Cross-User Data Leakage
- Verify RLS policies are enabled
- Check database queries include user_id filter
- Test with different user accounts

### Performance Issues
- Check database indexes are created
- Monitor query performance in Supabase dashboard
- Consider pagination for large message histories

## Security Notes

- All database operations use authenticated user context
- RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
- User IDs are validated on every operation
- No sensitive data stored in client-side state
- Automatic cleanup when users are deleted
